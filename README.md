This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: the null object reference error (#1009). The error occurs when attempting to access a property or method of an object that is currently null.  The example shows how to mitigate this error using null checks before accessing object properties.  This is crucial for robust and stable ActionScript applications.  The solution provides an updated `handleComplete` function that addresses this issue.
